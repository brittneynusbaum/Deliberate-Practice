#  4. Start with an array of numbers and create a new array with only the even numbers.
#     For example, [2, 4, 5, 1, 8, 9, 7] becomes [2, 4, 8].

## Round 2 ##
















## Round 1 ##

# numbers = [2, 4, 5, 1, 8, 9, 7]
# even = []

# numbers.each do |number|
#   if number % 2 ==0
#     even << number
#   end 
# end

# p even
