#  1. Start with an array of numbers and create a new array with each number times 3.
#     For example, [1, 2, 3] becomes [3, 6, 9].

## Round 2 ##

numbers = [1, 2, 3]
product = []
numbers.each do |number|
  product << number * 3
end

p product











## Round 1 ##

# numbers = [1, 2, 3]
# times_three = []
# numbers.each do |number|
#   times_three << number * 3
# end

# p times_three
